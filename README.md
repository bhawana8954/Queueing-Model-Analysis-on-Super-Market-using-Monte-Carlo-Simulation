# Queueing-Model-Analysis-on-Super-Market-using-Monte-Carlo-Simulation
This project work, titled "Queuing model analysis on Supermarket using Monte Carlo Simulation," delves into the intricate world of queuing theory and its application to a real-life supermarket setting.
The primary objective of this project is to develop a queuing model specifically tailored to a supermarket environment.
By utilizing the Monte Carlo simulation technique, which employs random sampling to analyze statistical phenomena, we aim to comprehensively assess and optimize the queuing system's performance. 
This simulation-based approach enables us to consider a multitude of factors, such as customer arrival patterns, service times, and queue discipline, all of which contribute to the overall customer experience.
